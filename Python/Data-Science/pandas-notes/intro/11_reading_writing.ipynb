    "# Writing and reading to different formats\n",

    "## Working with excel files\n",
    "- `xlwt` and `xlrd` are old libraries that are needed when you want to read and write with `.xls` files.\n",

    "\n",
    "However it isn't limited to this. If the url that you pass in was linked to a csv file, then you'd do `.read_csv(someUrl)`. If it was an excel file then `.read_excel(someUrl).`"
