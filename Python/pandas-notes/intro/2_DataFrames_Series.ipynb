    "## What are data frames?\n",
    "A CSV is basically an Excel table. Just rows and columns of data. A data frame is basically the same thing as it's a data-structure that contains those rows and columns, alongside a bunch of functionality that allows us to manipulate that data. Sometimes it may be easier to think about it is like a dictionary:\n",
    "```\n",
    "users = {\n",
    "  'username': [\"Knguyen44\", \"AbagailW3nd\"],\n",
    "  'email': [\"knguyen44@gmail.com\", \"abbyWendel@outlook.com\"]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Yeah it's kind of like this. Honestly if you're familiar with SQL databases, Excel, etc. then this should be simple to see. Our data frames are just these tables but with extra cool features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are series?\n",
    "This is just an 'array' of data, or just column of data, so you could have a series for the 'username'. This allows you to easily access all values in the username column, and also it adds cool new functionality and features to manipulate the values of said column. Of course you can get more complex with it, but this is the base idea. You could think of a data-frame as a collection of series that are teaming up."
