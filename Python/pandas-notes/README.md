# Pandas Notes
Notes on how to use pandas, apparently with examples. I'll be the one to say it, but Python has made it really easy to get, transform, and analyze data. 



## How to setup
```
<!-- Installs pandas itself -->
pip install pandas

<!-- For installing and working with Jupyter notebooks, which is a common way to work with  -->
pip install jupyterlab
```
Then download the stack overflow data. Now do `jupyter notebook` to start up a jupyter server. In order for this command to work you need to make sure that Python is set on your path variable. Now that you've started up this jupyter notebook, you should be able to connect this Jupyter server as your 'kernel', which just means that your pandas python code will work based on that environment.
