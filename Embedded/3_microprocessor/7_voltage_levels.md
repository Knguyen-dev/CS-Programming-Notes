# Voltage levels

## Voltage levels and digital logic
The microcontroller is going to register certain levels of voltage has either a high signal (1) or a low signal (0).

Go to your table of contents and you can find these:
  - $V_{IH}$: GPIO high level input voltage.
  - $V_{IL}$: GPIO low level input voltage.
  - $V_{OH}$: GPIO high level output voltage.
  - $V_{OL}$: GPIO low level output voltage.

So either high or low, but there's of course a margin or error or boundary in between that indicates an illegal state. Meaning that, it's in neither state and that's a problem.
