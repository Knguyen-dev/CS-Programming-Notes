# Intro to Electronics
Let's get an overview of how electronics and circuits work:
- Understand current, voltage, power, and energy.
- Learn Ohm's law, and then Kirchoff's laws for voltage and current in order to analyze circuits.
- Then understand circuit configurations like 'voltage dividers' and 'current dividers'.
