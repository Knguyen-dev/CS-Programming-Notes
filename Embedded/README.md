## What I need to take note of 
- Chapter 8 switches and leds. Here you're going to need to learn about the breadboard, switch interfaces, led interfaces, etc. So this guides 
you through applying your knowledge of switches and how'd you go about designing a small simple hardware project.






- Chapter 9 focuses on arrays and "functional debugging"
- Chapter 10 focuses on finite state machines, whatever those are. This is probably very important in terms of theory and whatnot


I think after this I'd like to take notes on:
1. [Complex Embedded Systems Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVl4RjlX2_RKmcjVUhmlFqhyzVf3NSTQ&si=Bn3J_tJA_DDu5lZs)

Then you'd need to replicate the labs done here, and do a roadmap of projects that take you from beginner in embedded to a little more knowledgeable. Some projects should be robotics to make things a little more interesting.

## What you're missing 
1. Networking
2. Analog electronics.
3. Embedded hardware concepts?
4. Embedded software concepts?
5. Also we definitely want to do practicals and other stuff because that's where the learning and fun is since you're applying theory.
6. Bonus: Verilog, or some kind of hardware language. Then FPGA programming, and then much much more.

I'm putting these here as you probably won't need to read all of it. With embedded, while it's good to know the electronics, you don't need to straight up become an electric engineer. Just enough to understand what's happening is alright. It's good that you already have a physics background.

I think my goal is to try to slip in the most important information. I mean it's kind of pointless of I copy the entire source material in here, as that's not really good notes.
