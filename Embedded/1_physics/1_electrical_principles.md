# Basic Electricity

## What is electricity?
Electricity is just the flow of electrons through a 'conductor', such as a wire. There are two types:
1. **Static Electricity:** Electricity that accumulates and stays in one place. You're familiar with this when you touched an object and got shocked. The reason it accumulates is because of an imbalance of electrons on a surface. 
2. **Dynamic Electricity:** Flow of electrons through a conductor, which is used to power devices. This is the electricity that we're mainly going to be working with.

## Types of dynamic electricity
- **Alternating Current (AC):** Current that comes from walls, and outlets. It powers big appliances that need to be plugged in. Current alternates direction frequently.
- **Direct Current (DC):** Comes from batteries, and powers smaller devices that use batteries. AC can be converted to DC, and vice versa, which is how your phone gets charged. Current travels in one direction.

## Basic Units 
- **Charge (Coulombs):** Electric charge is measured at a point, or on an object. It's basically the smallest unit of electricity as one electron has about $1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ coulombs.
- **Current (Ampere):** Rate of flow of electric charge. The higher the current, the more electrons and electric charge is going through the wire.
- **Resistance (Ohm):** This limits the amount of current flowing through a circuit. The higher the resistance, the lower the current.
- **Voltage/Potential Diff (Volt):** The difference in 'electric potential energy' between two points in a circuit. Voltage is the force that pushes charge through the circuit.
- **Power (Watt):** Rate at which energy is used (or generated depending on the context) in a circuit. Remember that 'watt' is joules/sec. You can view voltage as specific work, and current as the direction, and then their product constitutes power!
- **Energy (Joule):** Capacity to do work. Here it's the amount of work done by the electric current. It's just energy.

### Voltage Explained
We know that electricity is the flow of free electrons in a circuit. Then voltage is what pushes those electrons in a given direction. Imagine a water pipe. The pressure of that pipe causes the water to be pushed out of the pipe. The voltage is like the difference in pressure in and outside the pipe. 

Voltage is also referred to as potential difference, which is just how much work can be potentially done by a circuit. Imagine a lake separated by a wall. If those two lakes were at the same water level, then there's no potential to do work as one lake isn't spilling into the other. However if you raise one lake's water level meters above another, now there's a potential to do work as there's potential for one lake to flow down into another one. If we created a pipe and put a turbine there, we could power a town.

You can also think about it another way. Electrons on the negative side of the battery want to get to the positive side. We take advantage of this by creating circuits, creating a path for them to get to the other side. The more free electrons on the negative side, the more voltage there is (high potential). 

Voltage is pressure whilst volt is a unit of measure. One volt is the force required to push one coulomb through a one ohm resistor in one second.

## Ohm's law
Ohm's law is an equation $V = IR$. Using this we not only understand how voltage, current, and resistance relate, but it helps us analyze circuits.
