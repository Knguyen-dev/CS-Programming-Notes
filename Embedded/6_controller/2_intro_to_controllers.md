# 1. Controllers Intro

To use a calculator, a lot of the time you don't really need to know how to actually do the operations by hand. To drive a car, we don't need to know
how the engine works. 


### What I've decided.
When you watch a tutorial, make sure to apply it. I need to apply my learnings of microservices and spring. It just doesn't feel right to try to learn something new without applying the old thing.

Once I finish this assignment, i'll decide to focus back on embedded systems, and machine learning. Because right now on the course I'm headed, I'm headed on a course where I'm learning but not applying.
