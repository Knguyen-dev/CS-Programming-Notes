/**
 * + 'RedisConfig' (Aka SessionConfig): This is just a configuration class for spring session and how that's going to work
 * with your redis session store. Essentially with the '@EnableRedisHttpSession' (or similar annotation) and extending/inheriting
 * the class 'AbstractHttpSessionApplicationInitializer' will create a 'filter' in front of all our security logic. This filter
 * will look for active sessions and populate the security context with values stored in the Redis data store.
 *
 * + Annotations:
 * 1. '@EnableRedisIndexedHttpSession': This enables Spring Session support with Redis. So this allows them to work together
 * and makes that Redis session store to work. This creates a bean called 'springSessionRepositoryFilter' which replaces
 * the standard 'HttpSession' with a Redis-supported implementation. In this instance, Spring Session
 * is supported by RedisIndexedSessionRepository.
 * 2. '@Slf4j': Lombok annotation that adds a logger instance to the class. As a result, this allows for logging within
 * the class methods.

     * when you hear about 'connection factories' and 'lettuce' vs 'Jedis', this is what they're talking about.
