    "Process of cleaning and review data in order to derive insights such as some hypotheses, possible relationships, etc. With these results, you can then decide what to do such as generating hypotheses, preparing to use in an ML model, or even throwing out the data to get new data. \n",

    "1. **head():** Good for previewing your columns\n",
    "2. **info():** Good for seeing the amount of non-missing values, size taken up by the data, etc.\n",
    "3. **value_counts():** Good for seeing hte distribution of values over a series. Here we'd see the \n",
    "number of books in each genre.\n",
    "4. **describe():** Provides good summary statistics.\n",
    "5. **histograms:** Classic way of looking at hte distribution of numerical data. We create bins (x, y]\n",
