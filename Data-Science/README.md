# Data Science
Machine learning is this new shiny thing. I'd like to see if I'd enjoy it. Of course I'll still mainly focus on regular stuff, but this also sounds interesting.



## My Path
1. [AP Statistics Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics)
2. [Pandas - Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyhVh-qRZPA&list=PL-osiE80TeTsWmV9i9c58mdDCSskIFdDS)
3. [Numpy](https://www.kaggle.com/legendadnan/numpy-tutorial-for-beginners-data-science)
4. 
3. Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn





## Setup
1. [Download and get anaconda working](https://opentechschool.github.io/python-data-intro/core/recap.html)






1. Linear Algebra: Need to know about matrices and vectors, which form the language for algorithms
2. Calculus: For optimization, gradients, and derivatives
3. Statistics: Probability and statistics
