# Styling React

- Vanilla CSS:

* Simplest way to style.

1. CSS Modules: Lets you write CSS-style that are scoped locally
2. CSS Utility Framework: Provide a st of pre-defined classes that you can use in your markup. A popular choice would be Tailwind CSS, as it's basically a modern boostrap. It has the pre-defined classes, but also components as well.

- CSS in JS

* Allows you to use CSS with JavaScript. Just looked at styled-components as its one of the more popular ones in React's ecosystem.

- Component libraries

* Gives you pre-styled and premade components, so all of the designing is already done. Material UI, Radix, or Chakra UI.

# What we'll be noting

- We'll just be noting styled-components as it's a little more complicated, and it seems common. As well as this we're just going to go with tailwind css right now as it acts as a moderately decent components library with simple predefined classes.

# Styled Components

1. npm install styled-components

# Tailwind CSS

- Popular css framework. To use it we literally just need to add on predefined
  classes to add styles. If you already know css, then you should literally
  know about 95% of the library. The other 5% would be reading the "core concepts"
  section or just looking it up on their docs. Also if you already know bootstrap then
  the containers and breakpoints idea is the same thing.
