# Material UI Notes

- A UI component library for React. Styled following 'Material Design' specification, which is just
  list of best practices for web development made by Google. So this is just Bootstrap but by
  Google. When using material UI, we're basically just using components, and customizing the styles
  of those components through react props.

# Materials Icons:

- With the docs you have access to a library of material icons as well.
  Just literally search for material icons.

# Installation

1. npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled; install material UI
3. npm install @mui/icons-material; install for us to use icons
2. Install roboto font and material icons. You can do this via the cdns.

# Extra packages:

  So here you can manage form state and validation without complex state management
  or additional libraries.
2. Yup: JavaScript schema validation library used for form validation. Define a 
  schema for your data and validate stuff. Simple and powerful API for validation
  rules in your form fields
NOTE: Though we are mostly focusing on getting the hang of Mui libraries
