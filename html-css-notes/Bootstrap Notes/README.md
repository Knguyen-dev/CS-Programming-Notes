# Bootstrap 5

-   Boostrap: A widely used CSS framework that tries to make css styling a lot easier. Also has popular prebuilt, easy to implement components.

# HTML-CSS Support Extension:

-   Intellisense but for css, and it allows autocompletion of class names and ids, so it's really convenient.

# Setting up bootstrap:

1. Include primary bootstrap cdn links to your target html file
2. Now we have access to bootstrap. You should see that bootstrap has already applied default stylings.

# Boostrap grid system:

-   Grid system breaks things down into 3 levels: containers, rows, and columns.

-   row: Rows are actually using flexbox, which is why columns are evenly spaced. Grid uses a 12-column system where items share those 12 columns. Of course you can affect the amount of columns a singular column spans.

# Main Takeaway

-   Bootstrap provides you with the templates and foundational styles to get the job done, but if you don't like things such as colors or how something looks, you are
    encouraged to change and tinker with it to personalize it to your needs.
    You may not use everything that bootstrap offers such as the navbar, or even
    something important like the grid-system, but it's important to know that
    you can take something you like and try to customize it yourself.
