# Bootstrap 5

-   Boostrap: A widely used CSS framework that tries to make css styling a lot easier. Also has popular prebuilt, easy to implement components.

# HTML-CSS Support Extension:

-   Intellisense but for css, and it allows autocompletion of class names and ids, so it's really convenient.

# Setting up bootstrap:

1. Include primary bootstrap cdn links to your target html file
2. Now we have access to bootstrap. You should see that bootstrap has already applied default stylings.

# Boostrap grid system:

-   Grid system breaks things down into 3 levels: containers, rows, and columns.

-   row: Rows are actually using flexbox, which is why columns are evenly spaced. Grid uses a 12-column system where items share those 12 columns. Of course you can affect the amount of columns a singular column spans.

# Main Takeaway

-   Bootstrap provides the components, but it makes it very easy to change stuff around.
    As well as this, these notes aren't a comprehensive guide on the components, so the best
    solution would be reading the documentation when you really want to do something with a
    component. The docs are comprehensive and surprisingly easy to read.
