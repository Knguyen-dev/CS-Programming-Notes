# Bootstrap 5

-   Boostrap: A widely used CSS framework that tries to make css styling a lot easier. Also has popular prebuilt, easy to implement components.

# HTML-CSS Support Extension:

-   Intellisense but for css, and it allows autocompletion of class names and ids, so it's really convenient.

# Setting up boostrap:

1. Include primary boostrap cdn links to your target html file
2. Now we have access to bootstrap. You should see that bootstrap has already applied default stylings.

# Boostrap grid system:

-   Grid system breaks things down into 3 levels: containers, rows, and columns.

-   row: Rows are actually using flexbox, which is why columns are evenly spaced. Grid uses a 12-column system where items share those 12 columns. Of course you can affect the amount of columns a singular column spans.

# Boostrap Containers:

-   Containers in bootstrap will change their size automatically at different screen width breakpoints to make things more responsive.

1. class "container": For extra small screens, the container takes the entire width of the screen (fluid), but for larger screens, it'll just take a set amount instead. This is good enough for most use cases.
2. For example, "container-md" is a medium container. For sizes medium and up, it'll have a set width and snap accordingly to size changes. However, for sizes smaller than medium, it'll become fluid and take the full width. Remember this pattern.
3. 'container-fluid': Will always take up 100% of the width, hence the name.
