# Security controls


### Control categories
- Technical controls: Implemented using systems and software. Such as firewalls, anti-virus.
- Managerial controls: Located inside security policies and documents, associated with security design and implementation.
- Operational controls: Related to people, so security guards or awareness programs that teach people.
- Physical controls: Limits physical access; fences, locks.

### Control Types
- Preventive: Things that they to prevent the potential of an attack before it happens. Such as a firewall, door lock, or procedures that helps people avoid mistakes.
- Deterrent: Something discourages someone from attacking. Stuff like warning signs, threats of criminal charges when doing bad things, etc.
- Detective: Can identify and log when a breach happens. May not prevent it, but records it.
- Corrective: Does something after an attack happens. Tries to reverse impact of event, or at least minimizes damage.

- Compensating: Temporary solution that 'compromises'. Like when we find a bug in the system, the update to fix it is going to come later, so in the mean time we'll just restrict access to that part of the system for users.
- Directive: Direct/order people to do something more secure. A common standard or rule, or a sign saying 'Authorized personnel only'. The sign 'directs' people to enter or not enter.
