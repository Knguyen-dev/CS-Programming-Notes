# Laptop Displays


### Displays
- Liquid crystal display (LCD): Light shines through liquid crystals. It's light-weight, low power, and cheap. However, getting true black is hard, and also it needs a separate backlight. If a backlight fails, it makes it hard to replace or repair.
1. Twisted Nematic: Fast response time. However when viewing it at an angle, the color is shifted/distorted. So best viewing angle is front.
2. In Plane Switching: Has best colors, but is more expensive than 'Twisted Nematic'.
3. Vertical Alignment: Good color representation, but slower response time (a good inbetween).


- OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode): No backlight, so these are very thin and flexible, and no glass needed. Used on tablets, phones, smart watches, etc.


### Wifi antennas
- Wifi antennas are going to run behind your display. So when replacing your display you need to remember to connect the wifi wires and antenna wires.

### Camera, webcame, and microphone
- Webcam and camera should be on the top of your display. Camera used to record audio of course.


### Inverters
- Turns AC power into DC power. Some laptops have a backlight that uses AC power, but a laptop itself uses DC power.


### Touch screen/digitizer
- Digitizer: Converts touch input or input from a pen into information that a computer can understand.
