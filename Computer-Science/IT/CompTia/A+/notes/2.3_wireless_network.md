# Wireless network standards

### 802.11 standard (wifi standard):
- A: Original standard, using 5GHz and 54 Mbit/s.
- B: Uses smaller range, 2.4 ghz with a max speed of 11 Mbit/s; It has less problems with the signals being absorbed (bounces), and so it has more range.
- G: An upgrade of the 'B' standard. Uses same frequency range, but it can do 54 Mbits/s, and is backwards compatible with B standard. 
- N (Wifi 4): Operates on both frequency ranges. Up to 600 Mbits/s, big speed up. Uses (multiple-input-multiple-output), meaning the device (router) can transfer a lot more information simultaneously.
- AC (Wifi 5): Operates on 5 Ghz range. 
- AX (Wifi 6): Supports various different channel widths and operates on both ranges.

### Long Ranged Fixed Wireless
You'd use these antennas to create access points.

### RFID (Radio-frequency identification)
Allows badges to be scanned for authentication, and for tracking. Signals hit the rfid chip, is converted into energy, and then rfid chip sends back a signal; radar tech. While RFID is typically one way, NFC builds on RFID. It acts as an access token, allowing you to use your phone instead of a separate card to authenticate.
