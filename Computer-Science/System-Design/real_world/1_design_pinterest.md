## Let's talk system design interviews
1. **Consult interviewer/show skills:** Of course consult the interviewer to ensure you're on the right track, but your goal is to prove that you have the skills to independently design systems.
2. **Multiple solutions/trade-offs:** There are multiple solutions, so show your thinking and fluency. Also discuss trade-offs with different approaches.
