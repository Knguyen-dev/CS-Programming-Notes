The main topics or roadmap is in the section 'Index of System design topics'. However go to the section called 'Study guide' and follow the stuff listed there. You'll start by learning and reading through articles and whatnot. Eventually we'll be working through some system design interview questions and practice problems that'll allow us to design real systems, in theory at least.

System design isn't really something CS students worry about. You'd normally only worry about it if you were working in an actual business and an enterpreise application.
