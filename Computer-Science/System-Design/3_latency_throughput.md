# Latency vs Throughput

- **Latency:** The time it takes to do something, or get an answer. 
- **Throughput:** The number of actions we can do or the number of answers we can get per some unit of time.

### Example 1: Car Designer
An assembly line is making cars. It takes 8 hours to make a car and the factory makes 120 cars a day.
- **Latency:** 8 hours, because this is the amount of times it takes to yield a result, make a car.
- **Throughput:** 120 cars per day, or 5 cars an hour. Amount of results in a clear unit of time.
