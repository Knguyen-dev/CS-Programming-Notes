# CPU (Computer Processing Unit)

## What is it?
It 'executes' programs like Excel, Discord, Chrome, etc. All of your programs have code or instructions that are needed to run those programs. At the minimum your CPU need to communicate with the ALU to do math operations, and communicate with the RAM to do memory related operations.


## Situation

- Assume our RAM only has 16 different 8-bit memory address, so at eahc of these addresses it can store an 8 bit number. 
- Our CPU will have 4 8-bit memory registers (A, B, C, and D) which will be used to temporarily store
