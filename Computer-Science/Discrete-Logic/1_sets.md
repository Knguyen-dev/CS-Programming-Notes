# Sets
## Sets and Subsets: 1.1
- Set: A unique collection of elements. Such as a set of numbers, letters, etc. Order doesn't matter so the same set could be ordered differently. Sets are denoted by capital letters.
- Subset: A set that's inside another set. If every element in A is also in B, then A is a subset of B, denoted by A ⊆ B. If this isn't true, then A isn't a subset of B so A ⊈ B.
  1. A = B IFF A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A; if they are subsets of each other, then they have the same elements, then they’re equal.
  2. Proper subset: If A is a subset of B, and B has elements that aren't in A, then A is a proper subset of B denoted by  A ⊂ B. Here we know that the sets aren't equal, whilst in the other notation there was the possibility that they were.
  3. Empty (null) set: Set with no elements denoted by  ∅ or {}.
  4. Finite set: Either empty or has elements numbered 1 to n; it's countable.
  5. Universal set: Set that contains all elements for a particular context, denoted by U.
  6. N: Set of all natural numbers e.g. $\mathbb{N}=$ {0, 1, 2, 3 ...}. Typically includes 0.
  7. Z: Set of all integers $\mathbb{Z}=${... -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 ...}
  8. Q: Set of all rational (ratio) numbers, or numbers that can be represented by a fraction of integers. E.g. $\mathbb{Q} =$ {0, 0.5, 5.23, -5/3}
  9. R: Set of all real numbers, which is everything on the number line. Denoted by $\mathbb{R}$
- Elements: Objects or things that are in a set. So a ∈ A means that 'a is a member of the set A' or the idea that 'a' is contained in the set.
- Cardinality: Number of unique elements in a set. So the cardinality of set A = {1, 2, 3} is denoted by |A|, which is 3.
- Set builder notation: A set defined by specifying that the set includes all
