# Mern Stack Tutorial and Notes

- We separate the front and back end code in separate folders. Here 'backend' is our
  express app, and 'frontend' is our react app. So here we have the project's root directory
  opened, but we're able to cd into the front or back end folders as we please. So first
  we worked on our express backend, went back to root and created a react
  project with vite. Remember that our react app, and our express app are two different
  applications, so they have different package.json and dependencies

# React setup

1. npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react; initialize react app with Vite
2. npm i react-router-dom

# Server setup:

1. npm i express mongoose
2. npm i -D nodemon dotenv
