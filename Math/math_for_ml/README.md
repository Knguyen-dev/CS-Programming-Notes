## Overview
The basic math that you learn:
- Linear Algebra (Just Vectors/Matrices) 
- Probability
- Univariate and multi-variate derivatives
This goes by quicker if you already know this stuff. But 



### The Applications
- Data Processing: Linear algebra is used. We'll format data in a way S.T. machines can understand.
- Feature Engineering: Vectors and matrices, but we'll tr ansform data to make it easier for algorithms to understand.
- Modeling: We'll use probability, geometry, norms (L1, L2, etc), and statistics to define a problem in such a way that ML algorithms can optimize.
- Optimization: Vector calculus is used, but we'll iterate until certain conditions are met, and then we can choose the best model

### How this works:
The source material is a playlist of 79 videos. This is not including anything about Principal Component Analysis, I don't think, so in reality there's a lot more math. So it's my job to pack this down to make it concise whilst maintaining important information. Like specifically for ML. Like when you're reading this, you will see the topic, but I'll directly relate it to ML. There's
